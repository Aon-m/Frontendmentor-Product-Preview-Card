## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Monstserrat and Fraunces)
- Google Icons (Shopping cart)

### What I learned
- Allowing images to change based on media queries
```css
.perfume-image {
    background-image: url("images/image-product-desktop.jpg");}
```
- Use of:
```css
min(), clamp(),
```
- A better understanding of flexbox
- How to link google fonts

### Continued development
I might revisit this project once i learn about css grids.

### Useful resources
- [W3schools Flexbox tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
